# Hangman Game
This Hangman game is a simple word-guessing game according to the general established rules of a hangman game. The user can choose words from different types of movie titles. They than have to to guess a random title one character at the time. The user has 8 lives, correlating with a stick figure image which will have more sticks "drawn" onto the more lives are lost due to wrong guesses. The user either guesses the word correctly or, when there are no more lives left, looses and the full figure of the hanged man is shown.

Depending on how much knowdledge the user has about movie title the user will have it easiert or harder in this game. However this puzzle is meant to improve the user's critical thinking and problem solving abilities before they run out of lives.

There are visual clues as each line of the word to guess represents one character and the correct guessed ones will appear on the according position in the word. Moreover, the wrong guesses will be shown in a list and do not count as a second live once they have been entered.

## WIREFRAMES



## FLOW CHART / DECISION TREE
![Hang the man! Flow Chart Image](docs/lucid-chart.png)

The flow chart was created with [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) to help easily visualizing the flow of the program while passing each step. Like most decision trees some steps repeat themselves while other are final or starting points.

I wanted to show that winning and lossing the game isn't really an ending step as the user can still decide what to do afterwwards. This way the user has a lot of freedom and is not forced by the program on which route to take.
